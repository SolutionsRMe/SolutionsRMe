# 👋 Hi, I’m Amber Boudreau

**Self-taught developer · Automation advocate · Chaos-tamer**
I build stuff. Break it. Then build it better.

I'm relentlessly curious and stubborn in all the right ways. I learn by doing, debugging, and breaking things until something actually works — then making it better.

## 🔧 What I’m Building

### 🧩 The Solution Desk — Dev Tools & Automation for Real People

Tools that solve real-world problems, automate annoying tasks, and make developer workflows saner.

* **🛠️ Process Optimization App**
  A no-code automation assistant for small businesses.
  Automates repetitive ops using conditional logic and AI-enhanced workflows.

* **🤖 AutoHired**
  AI-powered resume + cover letter generator — *and* an automated job application bot.
  Uses OpenAI + browser automation to auto-fill forms, match keywords, and apply at scale.

* **🧠 ResumeBot CLI**
  A local-first command-line tool that generates tailored resumes and cover letters without needing internet access.
  Outputs styled Markdown and JSON for reuse across jobs.

* **🗃️ OrganiserPro**
  Cross-platform CLI app that organizes, renames, deduplicates, and categorizes files in seconds.
  Regex-powered and recursive with dry-run preview mode. Now supports zip extraction, duplicate hashing, and file fingerprinting.

* **📡 API Beacon (experimental)**
  A terminal-based API monitoring tool that tracks endpoint availability, latency, and status changes with CLI alerts.

* **🧠 AutoAgent**
  A local-first, modular GPT automation system for chaining shell actions, script execution, and Git workflows.
  Works offline, integrates with your terminal, and responds to prompt logic or voice triggers.

* **🧪 ShellTasker**
  Create named, reusable CLI automations with logging, fallbacks, and dynamic arguments.
  Think `make` meets Zapier.

* **📤 QuickDeploy CLI**
  One-command deploy for full-stack apps to Vercel or Netlify — scaffolds, commits, and ships in under 30 seconds.

* **🧩 Windsurf Extension Toolkit**
  Lightweight, automation-focused IDE plugin system.
  Designed for embedded or local cloud use with Open VSX support.

---

## 🚧 Coming Soon

* **Client Portal + Automation Dashboard**
  Self-service toolkit platform for freelance clients.
  Includes project templates, secure file drop, and AI support bot.

* **SolutionDesk CLI Suite**
  Unified interface combining AutoHired, ShellTasker, File Organizer, and Git toolkit.

* **AI-Assisted SOP Generator**
  Converts process notes or recordings into clean, versioned Standard Operating Procedures.

* **Security Toolkit**
  CLI-ready suite for testing token leaks, recon, endpoint security, and basic auth flows.
