# 👋 Hi, I’m Amber Boudreau

Self-taught developer · Automation advocate · Chaos-tamer  
I build stuff. Break it. Then build it better.

I'm relentlessly curious and stubborn in all the right ways. I learn by doing, debugging, and breaking things until something actually works — then making it better.

## 🔧 What I’m Building

### 🧩 The Solution Desk — Dev Tools & Automation for Real People  
I build tools that solve real-world problems, automate annoying tasks, and make developer workflows saner.

- **🛠️ Process Optimization App**  
  A no-code automation assistant for small businesses.  
  Automates repetitive ops using conditional logic and AI-enhanced workflows.

- **🤖 AutoHired**  
  AI-powered resume + cover letter generator — *and* an automated job application bot.  
  Uses OpenAI + browser automation to auto-fill forms, match keywords, and apply at scale.

- **🗃️ OrganiserPro**  
  Cross-platform CLI app that organizes, renames, deduplicates, and categorizes files in seconds.  
  Regex-powered and recursive with dry-run preview mode.

- **📡 API Beacon (experimental)**  
  A terminal-based API monitoring tool that tracks endpoint availability, latency, and status changes with CLI alerts.

- **🧠 AutoAgent (WIP)**  
  A local-first, modular GPT automation system for chaining shell actions, script execution, and Git workflows — powered by prompt logic.

- **🧪 ShellTasker**  
  Create named, reusable CLI automations with logging, fallbacks, and dynamic arguments. Think `make` meets Zapier.

- **📤 QuickDeploy CLI**  
  One-command deploy for full-stack apps to Vercel or Netlify — scaffolds, commits, and ships in under 30 seconds.
